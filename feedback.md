Hey Rachel,

It's looking good! I would delete the period after "BYU-Idaho" underneath your name. I don't know if that was on the original template, but it would make yours look cleaner in my personal opinion.
Also, underneath the valued Crew Member subcategory, your date is looking a bit messed up. It is supposed to be April?

See ya!
